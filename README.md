Sales Engine
============

This project was used to learn the inner workings of an ORM system by essentially creating our own.

We were given a test suite to run this project against and upon original completion of the program it took over 12 minutes to run the test.

After refactoring and implementing optimizations we were able to get the runtime of the test down to just over 2 seconds.

This project was also used as an opportunity to do a little metaprogramming.
